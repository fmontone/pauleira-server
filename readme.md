# Pauleira Server

This is a RESTful API developed to serve pauleira.com.br website.

For now, it's a very basic API that will grow up over time and by the time I start to implemente real business rules it will become a private repo.

The intent here is to be used as porfolio for my work.

If you need more info, feel free to send me an email at ("montone@gmail.com")[mailto:montone@gmail.com].
